# Chapter 1 Introduction

## 1-1 Signal Amplification

<div align = center><img height = 200 src = "../assets/ch1-1.png"></div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v_o(t) = C\cdot v_i(t) 
\end{aligned}
$$

- $v_i(t)$: input signal
- $v_o(t)$: output signal
- $A$: **amplifier gain**

### Case 1: Signal Transmission

A small signal need to be transmitted from a sender to a receiver through a wired channel

<div align = center><img height = 100 src = "../assets/ch1-2.png"></div>

It could be hard to be finished because the transmitting channels are noisy. Let $v_n(t)$ denote the noise voltage, then $v_r(t)=v_s(t)+v_n(t)$

<div align = center><img height = 200 src = "../assets/ch1-3.png"></div>

If the signal is amplified before transmission

<div align = center><img height = 100 src = "../assets/ch1-4.png"></div>

Then it could be easier to identify the receive voltage

<div align = center><img height = 200 src = "../assets/ch1-5.png"></div>

### Case 2: Digital Mobile Phone

The signal processing subsystem in a digital mobile phone

<div align = center><img height = 150 src = "../assets/ch1-6.png"></div>

- LNA: low noise amplifier
- A/D: analog to digital converter

Since the signal received by antenna is too weak, which is usually in $\mu V$ range, while the A/D converter required the input signal with the range from 0 to 3.3 V.

The processing could be much easier if the signal magnitude is larger.

## 1-2 Amplifiers

<div align = center><img height = 150 src = "../assets/ch1-7.png"></div>

The signal amplifier is a two-port network and only **dependent sources** could be used to realize amplifiers

<div align = center><img height = 250 src = "../assets/ch1-8.png"></div>

- $R_i$: input resistance
- $R_o$: output resistance
- $A_{vo}$: **open-circuit** voltage gain

### Different Amplifiers

### Amplifier Power Efficiency

<div align = center><img height = 250 src = "../assets/ch1-13.png"></div>

The DC power delivered to the amplifier is

$$
P_{dc} = V_{CC}I_{CC}+V_{EE}I_{EE}
$$

The power-balance equation over the circuit is

$$
P_{dc} +P_I = P_L+P_{\text{dissipated}}
$$

The amplifier power efficiency is

$$
\eta = \frac{P_L}{P_{dc}}\times 100\%
$$

### Characters of Amplifiers

There are several important parameter of amplifiers:

- $A$: Gain
- $R_i$: Input Resistance
- $R_o$: Output Resistance

#### Amplifier Gain

A voltage amplifier fed with a signal $v_i(t)$ and connected to a load resistance $R_L$

<div align = center><img height = 150 src = "../assets/ch1-14.png"></div>

- Voltage Gain: $A_v=\frac{v_o}{v_i}$
- Current Gain: $A_i=\frac{i_o}{i_i}$
- Power Gain: $A_p=\frac{v_o i_o}{v_i i_i}$

And there is relationship between power gain, voltage gain and current gain is

$$
A_p = A_oA_i
$$

And electronics engineers prefer to express amplifier gain with **logarithmic measure**

- Voltage Gain in decibels: $20\log\|A_v\|\;dB$
- Current Gain in decibels: $20\log\|A_i\|\;dB$
- Power Gain in decibels: $10\log\|A_p\|\;dB$

#### Input and Output Resistance

The input resistance $R_i$ is **an equivalent resistance** that accounts for the fact that the amplifier draws an input current from the signal source

<div align = center><img height = 200 src = "../assets/ch1-15.png"></div>

$$
v_i = v_s \frac{R_i}{R_i+R_s}
$$

A **voltage amplifier** with ***larger input resistance*** draw less current from the signal source, and its $v_i$ is closer to $v_s$

$$
v_o = A_{vo}v_i \frac{R_L}{R_L+R_o}
$$

A **voltage amplifier** with ***smaller output resistance*** has stronger ability to drive a heavy load

#### Determine Input and Output Resistance

- Determine $R_i$: by applying an **input voltage** $v_i$ and calculating the **input current** $i_i$
  
$$
R_i = \frac{v_i}{i_i}
$$

- Determine $R_o$: by finding ratio of the **open-circuit output voltage** to the **short-circuit output current**

### Overall Gain

- Voltage Gain
$$
A_v = \frac{v_o}{v_i} = A_{vo}\cdot \frac{R_L}{R_L+R_o}
$$
- Overall Gain
$$
\frac{v_o}{v_s} = A_{vo}\cdot\frac{R_i}{R_i+R_s}\frac{R_L}{R_L+R_o}
$$

### Characterizing Amplifiers

A perfect **voltage amplifier** should have

- large input resistance
- small output resistance
- a gain that is controllable ina wide range

# Chapter 2 Op Amp

## 2-1 Ideal Op Amp

### Models of Ideal Op Amp

From a signal point of view the op amp has three terminals: two inputs and one output terminal

|  Pin  |    Terminal    |
| :---: | :------------: |
|   1   | Negative Input |
|   2   | Positive Input |
|   3   |     Output     |

<div align = center><img height = 400 src = "../assets/ch2-1.png"></div>

Most IC op amp have 5 terminals: two inputs, one output and two DC power terminals

|  Pin  |    Terminal    |
| :---: | :------------: |
|   1   | Negative Input |
|   2   | Positive Input |
|   3   |     Output     |
|   4   | Positive Power |
|   5   | Negative Power |

### Function and Characteristics of the Ideal Op Amp

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-2.png"></div>

- Infinite input impedance
- Zero output impedance
- Zero [common-mode gain](#differential-and-common-mode-signals)
- Infinite open-loop gain A
- Infinite bandwidth

### Differential and Common-Mode Signals

The differential input signal $v_{Id}$ is simply the difference between the two input signals $v_1$ and $v_2$

$$
v_{Id} = v_2-v_1
$$

The common-mode input signal $v_{Icm}$ is the average of the two input signals $v_1$ and $v_2$

$$
v_{Icm} = \frac{1}{2}(v_1+v_2)
$$

Made the equation express $v_1$ and $v_2$ as

$$
\begin{cases}
    v_1 = v_{Icm}-v_{Id}/2\\[2ex]
    v_2 = v_{Icm}+v_{Id}/2
\end{cases}
$$

which could turn the input terminals into another presentation

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-3.png"></div>

### Analysis Method

There are tree rules to analyze the op amp circuit

- ==**virtual short**==: $v_+=v_-$
- ==**virtual open**==: $i_+=0,i_-=0$
- ==**zero output resistance**==: $R_O=0$

## 2-2 Inverting Amplifier

<div align = center><img height = 200 src = "../assets/ch2-4.png"></div>

The **closed-loop gain** G could be determined as

$$
G = \frac{v_O}{v_I}
$$

Since $v_-=v_+=0$

$$
i_1 = \frac{v_I-0}{R_1}=\frac{v_I}{R_1}\quad i_2 = \frac{0-v_O}{R_2} = -\frac{v_O}{R_2}
$$

And we have $i_1=i_2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{v_I}{R_1} &= - \frac{v_O}{R_2}\\[2ex]
    \frac{v_O}{v_I} &= -\frac{R_2}{R_1}
\end{aligned}
$$

- gain: $R_2/R_1$
- input resistance: $R_1$
- output resistance: $R_O = 0$

### T-shape Feedback Network

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-5.png"></div>

Since $v_-=v_+=0$

$$
i_1 = \frac{v_I-0}{R_1} = \frac{v_I}{R_1}
$$

And we have $i_1=i_2$

$$
v_x = -i_2R_2 = -i_1 R_2 = -\frac{R_2}{R_1}v_I
$$

Therefore $i_3$ could be determined as

$$
i_3 = \frac{v_x}{R_3} = -\frac{R_2}{R_1}\cdot\frac{v_I}{R_3}
$$

The output voltage could be calculated 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v_o &= v_x+i_4R_4\\[2ex] 
        &= -\frac{R_2}{R_1}v_I-(i_2+i_3)R_4\\[2ex]
        &= -\frac{R_2}{R_1}v_I-(i_1+i_3)R_4\\[2ex]
        &= -\frac{R_2}{R_1}v_I-(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{R_2}{R_1}\cdot\frac{1}{R_3})v_I R_4\\[2ex]
        &= -(\frac{R_2}{R_1}+\frac{R_4}{R_1}+\frac{R_2}{R_1}\frac{R_4}{R_3})v_I\\[2ex]
\end{aligned}
$$

## 2-3 Noninverting Amplifier

<div align = center><img height = 250 src = "../assets/ch2-6.png"></div>

The **closed-loop gain** G could be determined as

$$
G = \frac{v_O}{v_I}
$$

Since $v_-=v_+=v_1$

$$
i_1 = \frac{v_I-0}{R_1}=\frac{v_I}{R_1}\quad i_2 = \frac{v_O-v_I}{R_2}
$$

And we have $i_1=i_2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{v_I}{R_1} &= \frac{v_O-v_I}{R_2}\\[2ex]
    (R_1+R_2)v_I &= R_1 v_O\\[2ex]
    \frac{v_O}{v_I} &=(1+\frac{R_2}{R_1})
\end{aligned}
$$

- gain: $1+\frac{R_2}{R_1}$
- input resistance: $R_I = \infty$
- output resistance: $R_O = 0$

## 2-4 Difference Amplifier

A difference amplifier is one that responds to the difference between the two signals applied at its input and ideally rejects signals that are common to the two inputs.

Take the following two amplifiers into consideration

<div align = center><img height = 250 src = "../assets/ch2-7.png"></div>

$$
v_{O1} = -\frac{R_2}{R_1}v_{I1}\qquad v_{O2} = (1+\frac{R_2}{R_1})\frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4}v_{I2}
$$

To produce no response to the common part, which means $v_{I1} = v_{I2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v_{O1}+v_{O2} &= 0\\[1ex]
    \frac{R_2}{R_1}v_{I1} &= (1+\frac{R_2}{R_1})\frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4}v_{I2}\\[2ex]
    \frac{R_2}{R_1}\cdot \frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} &= \frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4}\\[3ex]
    \frac{R_4}{R_2} &= \frac{R_3}{R_1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now the common difference amplifier could be analyzed in the same way

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-8.png"></div>

The voltage on the input terminals could be determined as

$$
\frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4}v_{Icm}
$$

The current on $R_1$ is

$$
i_1 = \frac{R_3}{R_1} \frac{1}{R_3+R_4}v_{Icm}
$$

And we know $i_1=i_2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v_O &= \frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4}v_{Icm}-\frac{R_3}{R_1}\frac{R_2}{R_3+R_4}v_{Icm}\\[2ex]
    &= \frac{v_{Icm}}{R_3+R_4}(R_4-\frac{R_3}{R_1}R_2)\\[2ex]
    \frac{v_O}{v_{Icm}} &= \frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4}(1-\frac{R_2}{R_1}\frac{R_3}{R_4}) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Since we've chosen the resistor ratio, the gain for the common-mode is 0

But any mismatch in the resistance ratio could cause $A_{cm}$ nonzero, hence, high input resistance is required for a difference amplifier, which is called **differential input resistance** $R_{id}$

We assume that 

$$
R_3 = R_1\qquad R_4 = R_2
$$

And the definition of the **differential input resistance** is

$$
R_{Id} = \frac{v_{Id}}{i_I}
$$

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-14.jpg"></div>

Since the two terminals shares the same voltage, the loop seems to be a short circuit.

$$
v_{Id} = i_IR_1+0+i_IR_1
$$

Thus

$$
R_{Id} = 2R_1
$$

## 2-5 DC Imperfections

### Offset Voltage

If the two input terminals of the op amp are tied together and connected to ground, it will be found that despite the fact thar $v_{Id}=0$, a finite dc voltage exists at the output.

The op-amp output can be brought back to its ideal value of $0\;V$ by connecting a dc voltage source of appropriate polarity and magnitude between the two input terminals of the op amp.

It follows that the **input offset voltage** $V_{OS}$ must be of equal magnitude and of opposite polarity of the voltage

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-9.png"></div>

Based on the principle of superposition, we can find the both the inverting and the noninverting amplifier configurations result in the same circuit

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-10.png"></div>

The output voltage due to $V_{OS}$ is found to be 

$$
V_O =V_{OS}\Big[1+\frac{R_2}{R_1}\Big]
$$

### Input Bias and Offset Currents

In order for the op amp to operate, its two input terminals have to be supplied with dc currents, termed the **input bias currents**, which are independent og the fact that a real op amp has finite input resistance

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-11.png"></div>

The average value $I_B$ is called the **input bias current**

$$
I_B = \frac{I_{B1}+I_{B2}}{2}
$$

and the difference is called the **input offset current** and is given by

$$
I_{OS} = |I_{B1}-I_{B2}|
$$

> Typical values for general-purpose op amps are $I_B = 100 \;nA$ and $I_{OS}=10\; nA$

Now we can analyses the closed loop amplifier, taking into account the input bias currents

<div align = center><img height = 400 src = "../assets/ch2-12.png"></div>

$$
V_O = -I_{B2}R_3+R_2(I_{B1}-\frac{R_3}{R_1}I_{B2})
$$

Consider the case $I_{B1}=I_{B2}=I_B$, which results in

$$
V_O = I_B[R_2-R_3(1+R_2/R_1)]
$$

Thus output voltage could be zero when selecting $R_3$ equal to

$$
R_3 = \frac{R_2}{1+R_2/R_1}=\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}
$$

But in an **ac-coupled** amplifier the dc resistance seen by the inverting terminal is $R_2$, then $R_3$ is chosen equal to $R_2$

### Effect of Finite Open-loop Gain

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch2-13.png"></div>

Since the op-amp open-loop gain A is finite

$$
v_+-v_- = \frac{v_O}{A}\Rightarrow v_-=-\frac{v_O}{A}
$$

thus

$$
i_1 = \frac{v_{I}-(-v_O/A)}{R_1}=\frac{v_I+v_O/A}{R_1}
$$

Then the output voltage $v_O$ becomes

$$
v_O = -\frac{v_O}{A}-i_1R_2=-\frac{v_O}{A}-\Big(\frac{v_I+v_O/A}{R_1}\Big)R_2
$$

where the the closed-loop gain is found as

$$
G= \frac{v_O}{v_I} = -\frac{R_2/R_1}{1+(1+R_2/R_1)/A}
$$

Similarly, we could get the closed-loop gain for the noninverting amplifier

$$
G= \frac{v_O}{v_I} = \frac{1+(R_2/R_1)}{1+(1+R_2/R_1)/A}
$$

# Chapter 3 Diode

## 3-1 Ideal Diode

The **ideal diode** may be considered to be the most fundamental ==nonlinear== circuit element, which has two nodes:

- **anode**: the positive terminal
- **cathode**: the negative terminal

<div align = center><img height = 200 src = "../assets/ch3-1.png"></div>

If a negative voltage is applied

- no current flows
- reverse biased
- **cut off**

If a positive current is applied

- zero voltage drop
- forward biased
- **turn on**

<div align = center><img height = 600 src = "../assets/ch3-2.png"></div>

### A simple Application: The Rectifier

<div align = center><img height = 700 src = "../assets/ch3-3.png"></div>

### Another Application: Diode Logic Gates

<div align = center><img height = 400 src = "../assets/ch3-4.png"></div>

$$
Y = A+B+C
$$

For the figure (b), the circuit implements with the **logic AND function**

$$
Y = A\cdot B\cdot C
$$

### The Constant-Voltage-Drop Model

The simplest and most widely used diode model is the constant-voltage-drop model. This model is based on the observation that a forward-conducting diode has a voltage drop that varies in a relatively narrow range from 0.6 to 0.8 volt. The model assumes **this voltage to be constant at a value of 0.7 volt**

<div align = center><img height = 400 src = "../assets/ch3-5.png"></div>

## 3-2 Special Diode Types

### LED

<div align = left><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch3-6.png"></div>

The light-emitting diode converts a forward current into light and the current on the diode could be determined by

$$
i_D = \frac{V_{CC}-V_D}{R}
$$

> typical current ratings ranges from around 1 mA to 20 mA depending on the size of a LED

### Zener Diodes

# Chapter 4 Bipolar Junction Transistors

## 4-1 Device Structure and Physical Operation

The BJT consists of three semiconductor regions: the **emitter(E)** region, the **base(B)** region and the **collector(C)** region

<div align = center><img height = 250 src = "../assets/ch4-1.png"></div>

The transistor consists of two pn junctions, the **emitter-base junction** and **collector-base junction**. According to the different bias condition of each junction, there're three different working modes of transistors

|    Mode    |   EBJ   |   CBJ   |
| :--------: | :-----: | :-----: |
|   Cutoff   | Reverse | Reverse |
|   Active   | Forward | Reverse |
| Saturation | Forward | Forward |

### The npn Transistor

#### Operation in Active Mode

<div align = center><img height = 450 src = "../assets/ch4-2.png"></div>

The current on the collector could be defined as

$$
i_C = I_Se^{v_{BE}/V_T}
$$

- $I_S$: saturation current
- $V_T$: the thermal voltage ($25\;mV$ at room temperature)

The base current consists of two basic parts: the injected holes to the emitter and the recombined electrons from the majority current

$$
i_B = \frac{i_C}{\beta} = \Big(\frac{I_S}{\beta}\Big)e^{v_{BE}/V_T}
$$

- $\beta$: transistor parameter (mostly in range 50 to 200)

The emitter current is the sum of the base current and the emitter current

$$
i_E = i_C+i_B = \frac{\beta+1}{\beta} i_C = \frac{\beta+1}{\beta} I_S e^{v_{BE}/V_T}
$$

If we define

$$
\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\qquad \beta = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}
$$

Then the current of the collector could be expressed as

$$
i_C = \alpha i_E
$$

- $\alpha$: common-base current gain

<div align = center><img height = 450 src = "../assets/ch4-5.png"></div>

#### Large-signal Model

<div align = center><img height = 250 src = "../assets/ch4-10.jpg"></div>

The models above could be applied for any positive value of $v_{BE}$, and thus these models are referred to as **large-signal models**

#### Operation in Saturation Mode

<div align = center><img height = 250 src = "../assets/ch4-6.png"></div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    i_B &= (I_s/\beta)e^{v_{BE}/V_T}+I_{sc}e^{v_{BC}/V_T}\\[2ex]
    i_C &= I_se^{v_{BE}/V_T}-I_{sc}e^{v_{BC}/V_T}
\end{aligned}
$$

And the transistor parameter is defined as the ratio of the current on base to the collector

$$
\beta_{\text{forced}} = \frac{i_B}{i_C}\Bigg|_{\text{saturation}}\leq \beta
$$

And we also have the saturation voltage

$$
V_{CEsat} = V_{BE}-V_{BC}
$$

And the saturation voltage at the edge of saturation is $V_{CEsat} = 0.3\; V$, while a transistor deep in saturation has $V_{CEsat} = 0.2\; V$

### The pnp Transistor

#### Operation in Active Mode

<div align = center><img height = 450 src = "../assets/ch4-7.png"></div>

It can be easily seen that the current-voltage relationship of the *pnp* transistor will be identical to that of the *npn* transistor except that $v_{BE}$ has to be replaced by $v_{EB}$

And the *pnp* transistor can operate in the saturation mode in a manner analogous to that described for the *npn* device

#### Large-signal Model

<div align = center><img src = "../assets/ch4-8.png"></div>

## 4-2 Current-Voltage Characteristics

<div align = center><img height = 250 src = "../assets/ch4-10.jpg"></div>

The polarity of the device *npn* or *pnp* is indicated by the direction of the **arrowhead on the emitter**, which points in the direction of normal current flow in the emitter, also the forward direction of the base-emitter junction.

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch4-11.jpg"></div>

According to the concepts mentioned in the first part, we could find the voltage characteristics of the both kinds of transistors

<div align = center><img height = 300 src = "../assets/ch4-12.jpg"></div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    i_C &= I_S e^{v_{BE}/V_T}\\[2ex]
    i_B &= \frac{i_C}{\beta} = \Big(\frac{I_S}{\beta}\Big)e^{v_{BE}/V_T}\\[2ex]
    i_E &= \frac{i_C}{\alpha} = \Big(\frac{I_S}{\alpha}\Big)e^{v_{BE}/V_T}\\[2ex]
\end{aligned}
$$

> $V_T = \frac{kT}{q}\approxeq 25\; mV$
> for *pnp* transistor, replace $v_{BE}$ with $v_{EB}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \beta &= \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\\[2ex]
    \alpha &= \frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\\[2ex]
\end{aligned}
$$

## 5-1 Device Structure and Physical Operation

### Device Structure

<div align = center><img height = 400 src = "../assets/ch5-1.png"></div>
<div align = center><img height = 350 src = "../assets/ch5-2.png"></div>

The figures above show the physical structure of the n-channel enhancement-type MOSFET

- two heavily doped n-type regions: **source** and **drain** regions 
- thin layer of silicon dioxide of thickness $t_{ox}$: covering area between source and drain regions
- metal is deposited on the top of oxide: form the **gate electrode** of the device
- metal is also deposited on source, drain and **body** regions

### Physical Operations

#### Zero Gate Voltage

<div align = center><img height = 150 src = "../assets/ch5-3.png"></div>

With zero voltage applied to the  two back-to-back diodes exist in series between drain and source, which prevent the current conduction from source to drain as the voltage $v_{DS}$ is applied

#### Creating a Channel for Current Flow

<div align = center><img height = 400 src = "../assets/ch5-4.png"></div>

Apply a positive voltage $v_{GS}$ between the **gate** to **source**

- free holes are **repelled** from the region of the substrate under the gate
- the positive voltage **attracted** electron from source and drain region to the channel region, which created an n-type channel
- the induced n region forms a **channel** for current flow

Since the flow have been established

- the gate and the channel region of the MOSFET form a parallel-plate capacitor, with the oxide layer acting as the capacitor dielectric
- the electric field thus develops in the vertical direction
- the field control the amount of charge in the channel also the conductivity

> **threshold voltage** $V_t$: to accumulate enough electrons to the channel, $v_{GS}$ must exceed threshold voltage
> **override voltage $V_{OV}$**: the excess of $v_{GS}$ over $V_t$ is termed as **effective voltage** $V_{OV} = v_{GS}-V_t$

The magnitude of the electron charge in the channel

$$
\|Q\| = C_{ox} (WL) v_{OV}
$$

- $C_{ox}$: **oxide capacitance**
    $$C_{ox} = \frac{\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}$$
    - $\epsilon_{ox}$: the permittivity of the silicon dioxide
    $$\epsilon_{ox}=3.9\epsilon_0 = 3.45\times 10^{-11}\;F/m$$
    - $t_{ox}$: oxide thickness

#### Applying a Small Voltage

Now apply a **small positive voltage** $v_{DS}$ between drain and source

The current on the drain region is 

$$
i_D = \Big[(\mu_nC_{ox})\big(\frac{W}{L}\big)v_{OV}\Big]v_{DS}
$$

- $\mu_n$: the mobility of the electrons
- $W/L$: aspect ratio

Since the other factor are determined in manufacturing, we could denote the factor as

- $k_n=\mu_nC_{ox}'$: the factor termed process transconductance parameter
- $k_n=k_n'(W/L)$: MOSFET transconductance parameter

#### Increase Voltage on Drain

<div align = center><img height = 400 src = "../assets/ch5-6.png"></div>

As $v_{DS}$ is increased, the channel becomes more tapered and its resistance increases correspondingly. The relationship between $i_D$ and $v_{DS}$ could be derived according to the figure.

<div align = center><img height = 650 src = "../assets/ch5-5.png"></div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    i_D &= k_n'\big(\frac{W}{L}\big)(V_{OV}-\frac{1}{2}v_{DS})v_{DS}\\[2ex]
        &= k_n'\big(\frac{W}{L}\big)(V_{OV}v_{DS}-\frac{1}{2}v_{DS}^2)\\[2ex]
        &= k_n'(\frac{W}{L})\big[(v_{GS}-V_t)v_{DS}-\frac{1}{2}v_{DS}^2\big]
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Current Saturation

Increasing $v_{DS}$ over $V_{OV}$, the current through the channel remains constant at the value reaches for $v_{DS} = V_{OV}$. The drain current thus saturates.

<div align = center><img height = 700 src = "../assets/ch5-7.png"></div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    i_D &= \frac{1}{2}k_n'\Big(\frac{W}{L}\Big)v_{OV}^2\\[2ex]
        &= \frac{1}{2}k_n'\Big(\frac{W}{L}\Big)(v_{GS}-V_t)^2
\end{aligned}
$$
